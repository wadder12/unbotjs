name: UnInbox Discord Server

description: >
  Our core infrastructure is designed from the ground up for effective communication between you and the rest of the world.

  The webapp provides a flavoured experience of what email communication would be if it was re-imagined for how we communicate today.

  Features like "team collaboration", "conversation notes" and "new sender screener" are native, making communication easier and more intuitive.

  Built to work with your current email infrastructure or replace it entirely.

  We're not here to kill email, we're bringing it up to date, killing inboxes along the way.

  UnInbox isn't another email service, it's a better way to do email.

  And email is just the start.
