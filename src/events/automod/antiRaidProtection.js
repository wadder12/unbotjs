/**
 *  - built by wade5
 * Anti-Raid Protection Event Handler for Discord.js Bots
 * 
 * This module is designed to monitor and mitigate potential raid activities on a Discord server. 
 * It tracks the rate of new member joins within a specified time frame and applies temporary 
 * timeouts to all new members if the threshold is exceeded, indicating a possible raid.
 * 
 * Configuration Settings:
 * - `threshold`: The number of new members joining within the `timeFrame` considered to be a potential raid (Default: 7 members).
 * - `timeFrame`: The duration in milliseconds to monitor for rapid joins (Default: 60000ms or 1 minute).
 * - `timeoutDuration`: The duration in milliseconds for which new members will be timed out if a raid is detected (Default: 600000ms or 10 minutes).
 * 
 * Environment Variables:
 * - `LOG_CHANNEL_ID`: The ID of the Discord channel where notifications about potential raids will be sent.
 * - `MODERATOR_IDS`: A comma-separated list of user IDs for moderators who will receive direct message alerts in case of a raid.
 * 
 * This script requires the `discord.js` library and is intended to be used with a Discord bot that has appropriate permissions
 * to monitor guild member additions and apply member timeouts.
 * 
 * Ensure your bot has the `GUILD_MEMBERS` intent enabled and possesses the 'Moderate Members' permission on the server.
