## GPT Model Comparison: GPT-4 vs GPT-3.5

### Summary

In our assessment of GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 models for specific application needs, we observed notable differences in performance, cost-efficiency, and suitability for our project requirements. Below is a detailed comparison based on our findings.

### Performance and Response Time

| Model     | Description | Response Time |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| **GPT-4** | Stands out as the superior model, offering faster response times and improved accuracy over its predecessor. It is considered the best choice for applications requiring the highest quality outputs. | Approximately 0.15 seconds |
| **GPT-3.5** | Delivers commendable performance, especially when cost factors are considered. | Approximately 0.08 seconds |

### Pricing

The cost of usage for GPT-3.5 is particularly attractive for long-term projects:

| Model | Input Tokens Price | Output Tokens Price |
|-------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **GPT-3.5 Turbo-0125** | $0.50 per 1M tokens | $1.50 per 1M tokens |

A budget of $5 in credits could sustain operations for an extended period, making GPT-3.5 a cost-effective solution for projects with limited financial resources.

### Application Context

Our project leverages GPT models for processing and generating responses based on YAML file content, rather than functioning as a traditional chatbot. This specific use case benefits from the nuanced capabilities of GPT-3.5:

- The requirement for relevant information from API training data is minimized, aligning well with the strengths of GPT-3.5.
- Given the model's efficiency and cost-effectiveness, we decided to remove the Supabase query limit implementation, as the operational costs are significantly lower.

### Conclusion

While GPT-4 offers unparalleled performance and is the preferred choice for applications demanding the highest level of quality and speed, GPT-3.5 emerges as the more practical option for our specific use case. Its balance between cost and performance, particularly for projects not requiring the latest advancements in AI, makes it an attractive alternative. The decision to utilize GPT-3.5 is further justified by its affordability and the nature of our project's interaction with YAML files, where the incremental benefits of GPT-4 do not outweigh its higher costs.
